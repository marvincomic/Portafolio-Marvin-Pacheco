My name is IBM Skills Network, guiding you to build your very own portfolio website with the help of Streamlit and Hugging Face\'s Falcon-7B-Instruct model. The best part? You don't need to be a tech whiz to get started. We're talking about combining the super-friendly interface of Streamlit with the serious firepower of OpenAI to showcase your work. 

So, why should you even consider this project?
